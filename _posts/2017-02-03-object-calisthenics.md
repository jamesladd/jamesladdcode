#### TL;DR
9 steps to better software design today, by Jeff Bay:


Only One Level Of Indentation Per Method<br>
Don’t Use The ELSE Keyword<br>
Wrap All Primitives And Strings<br>
First Class Collections<br>
One Dot Per Line<br>
Don’t Abbreviate<br>
Keep All Entities Small<br>
No Classes With More Than Two Instance Variables<br>
No Getters/Setters/Properties<br>
